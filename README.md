## Plan
### Idea
Find the relationship between search rank and video attributes and analyze search ranking day by day. It's useful for content creation.
I will analyze children's content because it is one of the most popular and viewed segments on YouTube.
### Goals
- Extract data from YouTube
- Clean and optimizy Data set for analysis
- Load Data set to wharehouse
- Load Data set to DB (staging --> business)
- Analysis Data set
### Stack used
- Yandex Cloud platform: 
```Virtual Private Cloud, Compute Cloud, Object Storage(S3)``` 
- Airflow
- Postgres DB
- Tableau
- Docker
- Google API
- Python, SQL

## Realization
### Extract from YouTube
I used a Virtual Machine (CPU2, RAM 8Gb, HDD 50Gb) in Compute Cloud with [Docker containers](/docker) for Airflow and Postgres (not metadata store).
I have used the [Google API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list) in PythonOperator to extract information from search results with request: "–º—É–ª—å—Ç–∏–∫–∏ –¥–ª—è –º–∞–ª—ã—à–µ–π". There are two methods which I used search.list() and videos.list(). With these methods, I was able to extract the following information:
```csv
date_extract, video_id, title, description, view_count, like_count,comment_count, time_published, channel_id, channel_title
```
Then I defined [DAG](dag_create_tables_youtube.py) to create 2 schema with 3 tables (one is staging and two are business)
### Transform and Load
### Analysis
